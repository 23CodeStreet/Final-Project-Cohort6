# Final-Project-Cohort6

### Let's get started:

1. using your terminal, navigate into your 23CS folder (or whatever you've called the folder in which you've got your code projects)

2. clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/23CodeStreet/Final-Project-Cohort6.git final-project
```

if you want your local project folder to be called something other than 'final-project', just change the last bit to whatever you want your folder to be called

## Happy coding!
